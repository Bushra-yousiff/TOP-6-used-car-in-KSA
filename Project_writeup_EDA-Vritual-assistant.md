Bushra yousif 

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to explore most used cars of the Saudi market and utilize data set to recommend used vehicles in order to help women's empowerment and make clear list of the most-best used carso they can get/view the list without wasting time. I worked with data provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/reemalruqi/used-cars-in-saudi-arabia) and Yallamotor is website in ksa have a collection of used vehicles for sale.

## Design

This project originates for virtual assistant for women's empowerment based on clean , design and visualize all of client backstory requests
[Client request for best-most used car in SA](https://github.com/Bushra-yousiff/TOP-6-used-car-in-KSA/blob/ac52ccef2abdac8dd4fded415e57a7f7006d360e/Client%20request%20for%20best-most%20used%20car%20in%20SA.md)

## Data
The dataset contains 2280 cars with 6 features for each, 3 of which are categorical. A few feature highlights include measurements of car driven and prices, also an in-depth analysis of 2279 of them was undertaken to inform baseline models and feature engineering. 

## Algorithms

*Feature Engineering*
1. Cleaning data to be more to get values would also be close in reality
2. performing aggregrations function to get the most used list
3. Selecting subsets of dataframe to know the correlation between driven and price to get the best of the most used car status identified during EDA
4. Apply a mask on the dataframe to get/view the specific conditions based on client request


## Tools
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

## Communication
In addition to the slides presented,these are plots and visualizations
